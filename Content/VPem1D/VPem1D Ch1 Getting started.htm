        <div class="note">VPem1D is intended for above-ground data only. If data are found below the top of the model, the program will output an error and stop. A file named from the input VP model file and suffixed with <span class="filename">_data.log</span> will be output to help you visualize where the data are below the topography. It will contain a header and the prism top location, the receiver elevation, and the transmitter elevation.</div>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" ">Building a model</h1>
        <p>When attempting to build a physical property model, it is important to consider what is known and unknown about the area. First, you must start with the topography (i.e., top of the VP model). The simplest model is is a homogeneous unit and a VP basement. It is important to know that any heterogeneous sub-celling will not be done on the VP basement—you may need to insert a flat bottom.</p>
        <p>VP models are defined by a rectangular region in easting (x) and northing (y). The coordinates are always in metres and z is defined in elevation (ENU coordinate system).</p>
        <p>VPem1D only acts upon prisms underneath data locations. Therefore, a cross-line prism dimension of the nominal survey-line width is sufficient to full capture the resolution of the data. The along-line prism dimension is normally chosen to be roughly half the horizontal transmitter-receiver offset for slingram systems or half the receiver altitude for central-loop systems.</p>
        <p>Creating a model requires that the information you have (i.e., geologic surfaces and topography) is in ASCII format. It does not have to be gridded.</p>
