            <MadCap:keyword term="Viewport" />Viewport: Preserving and saving views </h1>
        <p>Geoscience ANALYST allows you to capture and preserve several points of view of configurations in the Viewport, along with the list of visible objects and their visual parameters. You can then revisit the view on command. </p>
        <h2 class="NoPageBreak">Saving active Viewport as a view</h2>
        <p class="Task">To create a view:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange objects in the Viewport in a configuration you want to be able to preserve and recall for future reference. </li>
            <li>Press <b>Ctrl+F1</b> (or <b>F2</b> through <b>F10</b>).</li>
            <li>In the dialogue box, give the view a name (optional), and either leave the <i>Save object and data visibility</i> box checked, or un-check it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <div class="indent">
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/en/view dialogGA.png" />
            </div>
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">When you check the box in the <i>Save object and data visibility</i> dialogue, Geoscience ANALYST preserves everything currently visible such as painted data and Visual Parameters settings. Un-checking the box preserves only the point of view.<br /></div>
        <p>You can now proceed with the manipulation of your object(s), and the configuration captured by the view can be recalled by pressing the corresponding F-key (<b>F1</b> through <b>F10</b>), or from the <i>Views</i> menu in the menu bar. </p>
        <div class="note">Saving / restoring views does not apply to 2D Viewports.</div>
        <h2 class="NoPageBreak">Copying views to clipboard </h2>
        <p style="page-break-after: avoid;">Geoscience ANALYST allows you to take quick snapshots of views in the Viewport and the 2D&#160;Profile Viewer that you would like to save as an image in the clipboard and paste in other applications. To do so, select a view and type <b>Ctrl+C</b> followed by <b>Ctrl+V</b> in separate editing software. </p>
        <div class="tip">The current viewport can also be exported as a <span class="fileext">.geoh5</span> workspace file, with all the visible objects and saved views. See the section about <a href="../4. Importing and Exporting/Exporting objects from Geoscience ANALYST.htm#exporting_viewport">exporting objects</a>.</div>
