        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" ">Building a model</h1>
        <p>When attempting to build a physical property model, it is important to consider what is known and unknown about the area. First, you must start with the topography (i.e., top of the VP model). The simplest model is the terrain model consisting of basement cells from the topography to the base of the model. It is important to know that any heterogeneous sub-celling will not be done on the VP basement—you may need to insert a flat bottom.</p>
        <p>VP models are defined by a rectangular region in easting (x) and northing (y). The coordinates are always in metres and z is defined in elevation (ENU coordinate system). Models may be horizontally rotated. Proper definitions are given in this document. </p>
        <p>Creating a model requires that the information you have (i.e., geologic surfaces and topography) is in ASCII format. It does not have to be gridded.</p>
