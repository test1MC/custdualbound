        <p>This guide covers the functionality of Geoscience INTEGRATOR and includes examples of practical applications you are likely to encounter when implementing Geoscience INTEGRATOR into your mining and/or exploration project. The case studies contained throughout the guide aim to demonstrate how Geoscience INTEGRATOR excels as a user-friendly yet robust tool capable of complex data management tasks. </p>
        <p>Project managers can input themes and formats into Geoscience INTEGRATOR, allowing users and team members  to import, integrate, organize, and manipulate the data. To accurately assess the gathered data, projects contain a multitude of specifications and monitoring options, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3D search spaces </li>
            <li>Coordinate system	</li>
            <li>Shifts</li>
            <li>Units</li>
            <li>Data files and sets</li>
            <li>Classifications</li>
            <li>Tags</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, the Geoscience INTEGRATOR document library facilitates the management of tools such as detailed reports, presentations, and publications. The system administration toolkit efficiently manages users, settings, and preferences, while robust user permissions ensure the security of stored data.</p>
        <p>Geoscience INTEGRATOR can work in conjunction with Geoscience ANALYST to provide front-end 3D graphics based on the data compiled in a project, through a dedicated link that allows advanced querying options.</p>
