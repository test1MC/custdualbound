        <p>data sets are containers for data filed under themes. They can have documents, files, and tags associated with them. </p>
        <p>A data set that contains no data is referred to as a placeholder that you can use to represent data. It may be the case that some data are missing or you are unable to import certain data, but you still wish to have that data filed under a theme. </p>
        <p>You can associate relevant files and tags to a data set placeholders, as you would do with populated data sets.</p>
        <p>In Geoscience INTEGRATOR's <b>data set explorer</b>, there is a module <span style="color: #007688;">(i)</span> where you can view the data sets and any existing data set placeholders <span style="color: #007688;">(ii)</span>. </p>
