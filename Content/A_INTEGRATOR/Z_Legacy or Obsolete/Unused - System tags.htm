        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" ">System tags</h1>
        <p>System tags are theme-based and assigned automatically at the system level upon importing data. For example, all data imported into the Microseismic theme will be assigned the Microseismic theme system tag. Geoscience INTEGRATOR provides a list of all system tags with data on the right-hand side of the Tags screen. You can click on any of the system tag theme names to view a list of all data sets associated with that theme.</p>
        <p>System tags are particularly useful to further filter data that is tagged with a project or user tag, for a theme. It is possible to search through tagged data by combining a user or project tag and a system tag. For example, if we have many data types tagged with project tag ‘February 7th, 1999 level 755 rockburst’, it is possible to filter that tagged data to only view which of this data pertains to the Microseismic theme.</p>
        <p class="Task">To view tagged data that pertains to a particular theme:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <i>Current tags</i> table of the <i>Tags</i> page, Select one or more tags . </li>
            <li>Click the magnifying glass to see all the data associated to those tags. </li>
            <li>Click any of the system tags listed at right to see only the data associated to that system tag. </li>
        </ol>

            </br>In general, system tags are created automatically in Geoscience INTEGRATOR, however, there are exceptions  for some themes. These particular themes can support data of various nature as opposed to themes that support explicit (or particular) subjects.  These ‘support themes’ are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Drillholes (only drillhole interval and point logs templates)</li>
            <li> Samples </li>
            <li> Observation points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, you may have a CSV file that contains Drillhole interval data, where the properties listed are <i>drillhole ID, from, to, gold, copper, density, resistivity, </i>and<i> RQD.</i> All these properties are imported under the Drillholes theme because the data was collected in a drillhole and possesses <i>drillhole ID</i>, <i>from</i> and <i>to</i> fields. However, <i>gold</i> and <i>copper</i> , by their nature, are part of the Geochemistry &amp; Mineralogy theme, while <i>density</i> and <i>resistivity</i> are part of the Physical properties theme, while <i>RQD</i> is part of the Geotechnical monitoring theme. In these particular themes,  you can identify to which system tag the data belongs.</p>
