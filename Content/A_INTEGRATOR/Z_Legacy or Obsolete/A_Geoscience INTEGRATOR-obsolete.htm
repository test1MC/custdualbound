        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Geoscience INTEGRATOR is a multi-user, multi-site data management system for geotechnical, mining, and exploration data, which can be customised for the specific data management needs of individual mine sites. It excels as a tool to store, group, and query multi-disciplinary exploration, mining, and geotechnical data, models, files, and documents. It has powerful and intuitive query capabilities that can generate and manage scheduled, data-triggered, or on-demand reports. It is the foundation to bring many types of different data together for integration and modelling.</p>
        <p>As a true 4D  data management system (x, y, z, time), Geoscience INTEGRATOR natively handles 3D spatial and temporal data for any data type for which spatial position or time is relevant. The diagram below illustrates the general system configuration from a user perspective.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/GI functionality diagram scheme.png" style="margin-left: 65px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;" /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The data management system is server-based, with client applications accessing the server over a private network or the Internet. Users gain access through a fine-grained permissions system, under the control of the system administrator. Two client applications are provided: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> A web browser for system setup and management; data import and export; display of files, documents, tables, and charts of data; and customised report set-up through either self-serve or system-defined reporting, accessed directly in the web browser or by automated email distribution.</li>
            <li> A 3D visualisation application that displays data in the context of maps and 3D geological models. Both the web browser and 3D visualisation applications support complex spatial, temporal, and property-value queries. Additional applications can be developed by end users using Geoscience INTEGRATOR’s Application Programming Interface (API) provided with the system.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The system connects to site data sources for real-time, continuous update or ad-hoc update. Data entry to the system is simple and can be automated according to user-customized specifications. Data streams are captured, quality-controlled, and conditioned by the system directly from web browser entry, from other site databases, or from flat files on a file network system. The management of documents, files, and their links to data is simple and effective. </p>
