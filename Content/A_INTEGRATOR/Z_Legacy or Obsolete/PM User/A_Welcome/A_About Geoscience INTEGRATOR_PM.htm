        <p>Geoscience INTEGRATOR is a 4D (3 spatial dimensions and time) web-based data management system allowing users to integrate all project data in a single repository shared by multiple team members. It excels as a tool to store, group, and query multi-disciplinary exploration, mining, and geotechnical data, models, files, and documents. It has powerful and intuitive query capabilities that can generate and manage scheduled, data-triggered, or on-demand reports. </p>
        <p>Geoscience INTEGRATOR allows you to measure factors such as rock quality, geometry, seismicity, and stress, all in an effort to help you and your team understand how these earth properties coalesce with mine infrastructure. Using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> in conjunction with Geoscience ANALYST allows you to assess when and where  geotechnical hazard events such as rock bursts, roof falls, and floods are most likely to occur, thus bringing an increased level of safety to your project and to the people involved in it. </p>
