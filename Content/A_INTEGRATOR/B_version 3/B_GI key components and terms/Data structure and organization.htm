        <p>When you log into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> through the web browser application, the homepage you see is the <span class="ui">Projects summary</span> page, which displays an overview of the active project and any other projects you have permission to see. You can return to this page at any time by clicking on the <span class="ui">Geoscience INTEGRATOR</span> icon at the top left of your screen.</p>

        <p>At the bottom right of the user interface, you can send a message to support by clicking on <span class="uiClick">Contact support</span>, or switch language preference by hovering over the  language menus.</p>
        <p>The image below gives you an idea of how data may be structured in a project:</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Projects" />Projects</h1>
        <p><span class="ui">Projects</span> are the highest-level item in the data structure of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, and they typically represent mine sites or exploration properties. There is no restriction on what a project can be: it is a collection of data sets with a common coordinate system and files that have been grouped together under a single project name. User access is set per project.</p>
        <p>The <span class="ui">Project summary</span> homepage provides an overview of general information pertaining to the projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> the project name</li>
            <li>the project description</li>
            <li> the project manager</li>
            <li>the project creator</li>
            <li>the date of creation</li>
            <li>the list of themes that currently contain data sets.  Clicking on a theme from any project navigates you directly to the <span class="uiClick">Data set explorer</span> page of that project and theme, ready to access the data. (Themes and data sets are explained next.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can switch projects by selecting a different project from the <span class="ui">All projects</span> table or from any page at any time by hovering over the <span class="uiClick">Project</span> menu at the top of the page and selecting from the drop-down list.</p>

        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" "><a name="Themes"></a>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Themes" />Themes</h1>
        <p><span class="ui">Themes</span> are containers for <span class="ui">data sets</span>, designed to organize the data based on its type. Having data grouped in themes helps you to locate data intuitively. (See also <MadCap:xref href="#DataSets">"Data sets" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.)</p>
        <p>Some themes are grouped together under a more general name. For example, you would find extensometer data in the <span class="uiClick">Ground deformation</span> theme, which is grouped under <span class="uiClick">Geotechnical monitoring</span> along with the <span class="uiClick">Microseismic</span> and <span class="uiClick">Stress</span> themes.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of themes available in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/en/GI themes list.png" class="indent" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" />
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/en/GI themes list2.png" class="indent" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can navigate between themes by hovering over the <span class="ui">Theme</span> menu at the top of the page and selecting from the drop-down list. This list is minimized to show only the themes that currently contain data sets, but you can switch to the complete list of themes by clicking the <span class="uiClick">Show all themes</span> button (you can toggle between both display options with this button).</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <div class="note">When launched again, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> defaults to the most recently selected theme of the most recently selected project. </div>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" "><a name="DataSets"></a>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Data sets" />Data sets</h1>
        <p><span class="ui">Data sets</span>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Object types:Drillholes" /> are useful containers for organizing the same sort of data into different subsets that are meaningful to users. For example, it could be helpful to separate surface drillholes and underground drillholes in the <span class="uiClick">Drillholes</span> theme, or data in the <span class="uiClick">Samples</span> theme could be split between outcrop samples and drill core samples, or water samples and soil samples. Data sets in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> are meant to have the same meaning by which geoscientists and engineers intuitively refer to "data sets."</p>
        <p>Your data can be either imported into a new or already-existing <span class="ui">Data set</span> or uploaded as a file and linked to a <span class="ui">Data set</span>. In the first case, the data is stored as records in the database, which are combinations of mandatory properties and optional user-created properties that can be queried later for data analysis and reporting. In the second case, the linked data file can be downloaded at any time to open in any pertinent application. This way, any set of data  can be stored and organized into the theme structure, regardless of format.</p>
