        <h1 MadCap:autonum=" ">About</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is a 4D multi-disciplinary data management system for geotechnical, mining, and exploration data, models, and metadata. It allows the integration of data in a single, secure repository shared by all team members for retrieval, analysis, and decision making. This multi-user, multi-site data management system has powerful and intuitive query capabilities. It can generate and manage scheduled, data-triggered, or on-demand reports.</p>
        <p>Its geohazard assessment module provides a framework for using all available data to better understand, forecast, and mitigate geohazards. It supports geotechnical real-time hazard assessment and delivers scheduled or triggered reports for real-time decision making.</p>
        <p>As a true 4D data management system (x, y, z, time), <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> handles 3D spatial and temporal data for any data type for which spatial position or time is relevant. The diagram below illustrates the general system configuration from a user perspective. </p>
        <p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/GI functionality diagram scheme.png" style="margin-left: 65px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The system connects to site data sources for real-time, continuous update or ad hoc update. Data entry to the system is simple and can be automated according to user-customized specifications. Data streams are captured, quality-controlled, and conditioned by the system directly from web browser entry, from other site databases, or from flat files on a file network system. The management of documents, files, and their links to data is simple and effective.</p>
        <p>The data management system is server-based, with client applications accessing the server over a private network or the internet. Users gain access through a fine-grained permissions system under the control of the system administrator. Two client applications are provided:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A web browser for system setup, data management and data analysis; data import and export, data tagging, display of files, documents, tables, and charts of data; and customized report setup through either self-serve or system-defined reporting, accessed directly in the web browser or by automated email distribution.</li>
            <li>A powerful 3D visualization application with query interface, that displays data in the context of maps and 3D geological models.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Both the web browser and 3D visualization applications support complex spatial, temporal, and property-value queries. Additional applications can be developed by end users connecting to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> through a RESTful API (Application Program Interface).</p>
