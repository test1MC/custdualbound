            <MadCap:keyword term="Maps/plans/sections" />Maps / plans / sections</h1>
        <p>This section  is a repository within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, much like the <span class="uiClick">File manager</span>, that allows you to upload, store, filter, and sort files related to maps, level plans, and cross sections of  mining and exploration sites. The same list of <span class="ui"><MadCap:keyword term="File types" />File types</span> used in the <span class="uiClick">File manager</span> is available here. You can associate <span class="uiClick">Maps / plans / sections</span> to Tags and Data sets, which is a very powerful tool as it allows you to rapidly identify elements that can go together even if they are of assorted formats. </p>
        <p>The <span class="uiClick">Maps / plans / sections</span> page functions similarly to the <span class="uiClick">File manager</span> tool, with the additional feature of  listing layer names from DWG and DXF file.&#160;It does not allow you to flag a file as a "data file". The layers list gives you information on the content of a map, plan, or section document without having to open it.</p>
