        <p>The <span class="uiClick">File manager</span>  is a repository within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> that allows you to upload, store, filter, and sort project-related files of different types.  You can associate files to tags and data sets. </p>
        <div class="note">It is possible to associate a file to individual data records; however this is not done via the <span class="uiClick">File manager</span>, but in <span class="uiClick"><MadCap:keyword term="Reporting" />Reporting</span> (see <MadCap:xref href="../F_Reporting/Reporting.htm#AssigningTagsFilesToRecords">"Assigning tags and files at the record level" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>).</div>
